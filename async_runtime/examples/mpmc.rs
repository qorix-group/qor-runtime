// This is a test program and the following should happen:
// * create an AsyncRuntime with 1 worker and a queue size of 8.
// * spawn a task on the runtime that spawns 14 tasks on the same worker again
// * tasks 0 to 7 are added to the workers local queue
// * when task 8 is added, there is no more room in the local queue, resulting in half of the queue
//   being pushed to the global queue, namely tasks 0, 1, 2, 3
// * tasks 9, 10, 11 are pushed to the local queue
// * when task 12 is added, tasks 4, 5, 6, 7 are again pushed to global queue
// * task 13 is pushed to the local queue
// * tasks 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 are now in the local queue and executed in this order
// * worker is beginning to search for work: tasks 0 to 7 are taken from global queue to the
//   workers local queue
// * tasks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are executed in this order
// * worker is again searching for work but it does not find anything this time
// * worker is going to sleep
